# Learning Encryption
* I am learning cryptography by writing various encryption programs.
* I will put all of my projects in this github repository.

## Current Progress
* Caesar Cipher 
	** A Ceasar Cipher shifts all letters by a set amount. To decrypt, the receiver shifts all letters backwards by the same amount
	** I built a basic GUI that can encrypt and decrypt by a an arbitrary amount. Test it out by by launching the included .jar file (Encryption/Caesar/out/artifacts/Caesar_jar/Caesar.jar)
