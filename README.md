# Learning Encryption
* I am learning cryptography by writing various encryption programs.
* I will put all of my projects in this github repository.

## Current Progress
* Caesar Cipher 
  * A [Ceasar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) shifts all letters by a set amount down the alphabet. To decrypt, the receiver shifts all letters backwards by the same amount
  * I built a basic GUI that can encrypt and decrypt by a an arbitrary amount. Test it out by by launching the included .jar file (Encryption/Caesar/out/artifacts/Caesar_jar/Caesar.jar)
  * My next step will be writing a program for cracking Ceasar ciphers
